I would like to express my sincere gratitude to individuals who have helped me throughout my academic journey at Harvard and made this thesis possible.

I would like to thank my advisor, mentor and friend, Dr Pavlos Protopaps for his guidance, encouragement, and advice.
His expertise in physics-informed deep learning and his passion for research have greatly inspired me.

I would like to thank my parents, Junliang Liu and Yijin Chen, for their unconditional love and belief in me ever since I was born.
Without their support, I would not be where I am today.
They are the best parents in the world.

Finally, I would also like to thank my girlfriend, Xiyue Huang, for being my best friend and most trusted confidante. 
Her love and support helped me navigate through the most difficult times during the completion of this thesis.

To all those who helped this thesis in any other way, I thank you.
