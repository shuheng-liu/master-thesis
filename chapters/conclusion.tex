This thesis proposes various error-bounding algorithms for any PINN solution to certain classes of ODEs and PDEs. 
These algorithms only require the residual information $r(\cdot)$ and the equation structure $\mathcal{D} v = f$ as input.
With these algorithms, PINNs can be trained until the error falls below a specified tolerance threshold.
The mathematical relationship between residual and error bound also sheds light on optimizing PINN solutions for future studies.
