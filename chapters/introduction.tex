Differential equations (DEs) are a useful mathematical tool for describing various phenomena in natural sciences, engineering, and humanity studies. 
As universal approximators, neural networks are powerful in approximating unknown functions. 
With back-propagation and modern computing devices, neural networks are convenient to differentiate, making them an ideal choice for solving differential equations.

However, a major criticism of neural network solutions to DEs is the lack of error bound. 
Traditional numerical methods, such as the finite difference method (FDM) and the finite element method (FEM), compute numerical solutions with known error bounds.
Unlike traditional methods, the error bounds of neural network solutions are not well-studied.
Therefore, solving DEs with neural networks requires ad hoc customization and empirical hyperparameter finetuning.
If the error of \textit{any} given network can be bounded, we can train neural networks until the error falls below a specified tolerance threshold.

Our contribution is that we propose rigorous error-bounding algorithms for any neural network solution to certain classes of equations, including linear ODEs, certain nonlinear ODEs, and first-order linear PDEs.
These algorithms can also be extended to bound the error of other classes of equations as well.
The proposed algorithms only use residual information and equation structure as inputs and do not rely on assumptions of finetuning.
